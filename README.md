# Population entry

Shows a page that allows the user to select a country from a list and enter their population. 

The dropdown sorts the list of countries by name initially
The user can select a country from a dropdown, and enter a population for that country
The list is then sorted by population (highest first), then name.
The user can also delete an entry, thereby removing the population for that country.

Styling is minimalist
